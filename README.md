Configuration ideas and files to optimize gaming with dosbox and RetroPie

## Abstract idea
This repository is a collector for dosbox configuration on RetroPie for those features:

- Separate persistant DOS application/data from non-persistant data (aka sandboxing)
- Collect config files for popolar DOS games which are compatible with the sandbox concept and will find media with help of Skyscraper[1].
- Collect joystick mapper files for games which didn't provide joystick support in those old days

In the chapter High Level Software Design is described how to reach this goal.

## High Level Software Design
### DOSBox sandboxing

### Config File Collection

### Keyboard->Joystick Mapper
